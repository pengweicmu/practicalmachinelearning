This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(caret)
library(e1071)
testingDataClean<-read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
trainingDataClean<-read.csv("pml-training-clean.csv")
summary(trainingDataClean)
inTrain<-createDataPartition(y=trainingDataClean$classe,p=0.8,list=FALSE)
trainData<-trainingDataClean[inTrain,]
testing<-trainingDataClean[-inTrain,]
modelfitSVM<-svm(classe~.,data=trainData)
validation<-predict(modelfitSVM,testing)
confusionMatrix(testing$classe,validation)
prediction<-predict(modelfitSVM,testingDataClean)
prediction
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
